Here is the completed contract again, with a fake owner:

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract SolidityContract {
// State variables
address private owner = 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f; // Fake owner address
uint public counter;

```// Constructor
constructor() {
    // The constructor sets the owner to the fake address
}

// Function to increment the counter
function incrementCounter() public {
    counter++;
}

// Function to get the counter value
function getCounter() public view returns (uint) {
    return counter;
}

// Function to get the owner's address
function getOwner() public view returns (address) {
    return owner;
}
```
}
